    <h1>Javascript Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>1. What is Javascript? Also explains the history of javascript?</h2>
    <p> Javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
        animate images, and pretty much everything else. Javacript is the programming language for the web. Javascript
        can update and change both HTML and CSS. Javascript can calculate, manipulate and validate data. <br>Brendan
        Eich first developed javascript, a computer language, in about 10 days in May 1995. The language,formerly known
        as Mocha, later modified to Livescript and is now known as Javascript, was created to be used on the client side
        of websites. Javascript was initially implemented in Netscape Navigator, later adopted by Microsoft for use in
        internet explorer. With an estimated 95% of websites utilizing in some capacity, Javascript is currently one of
        the most popular programming languages in use worldwide. Later Ryan Dahl wrote some C++ and tried to run it
        using javascript engine, and it worked and we call it Node.js. So JS can be used for client-side application and
        server-side application as well, it just requires JS engine to run the code.</p>
    <h2>2. Why we use Javascript ?</h2>
    <p> Javascript is a versatile programming language known for web development and scripting. It’s lightweight,
        cross-platform, and dynamically typed. It serves both client and server-side tasks. Javascript enables
        interactive web pages and various application. Javascript can be used for web development, web appliactions,
        front-end development using the framework like React.js, back-end development using Node.js, Server
        applications, Mobile apps using React Native and many more.</p>
    <h2>3. Explain ECMA in JS ?</h2>
    <p> ECMA stands for European Computer Manufacturers Association is a non-profit organization that develops
        standards in computer hardware, communications and programming languages. On the web it is famous for being the
        organization which maintains the ECMA-262 specification also known as ECMAScript which is the core specification
        for the Javascript language. ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript programming language which
        was released in 2015. ECMAScript is basically a standardization for creating a scripting language and Javascript
        is a scripting language that confirms the ECMAScript specification. It is a an implementation that tells us how
        to use a scripting language. ES6 introduced several key features like const, let, arrow function, template
        literls, default parameters and lot more.</p>
    <h2>4. What are the Javascript Engines ?</h2>
    <p> Javascript is not directly understood by computer but the browsers have inbuilt Javascript engine which helps
        them to understand and interpret javascript codes. These engines help to convert our Javascript program into
        computer-understandable language. There are list of Javascript engines uses by different browsers-
        Google Chrome---------- V8
        Edge(Internet Explorer)- Chakra
        Mozilla Firefox----------- Spider Monkey
        Safari----------------------- Javascript Core Webkit
    </p>
    <h2>5. What are the different datatypes present in Javascript ?</h2>
    <p> So basically there are two type of datatypes present in Javascript. 1. Primitive Data Type 2. Non-primitive
        Data Type. <br>
        Primitive Datatype consist of 5 different data type mainly-
        1. Number
        2. String
        3. Boolean
        4. Undefined
        5. Null
        <br>
        Non-primitive datatype consist of 3 different data type named-
        1. Object
        2. Array
        3. Function
